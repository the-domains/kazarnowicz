description: "Somewhere along the way, \"sharing is caring\" has been twisted into \"sharing is being\" and in that process we lost source criticism. It may not be dead yet, but it's definitely missing. It's everywhere. It's in the media, where sensationalized headlines are formulated not only to pique our interest, but to provoke that click by tantalizing our imagination without revealing anything."
